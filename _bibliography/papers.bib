abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly applied across various domains, favoured by the growing acquisition and public availability of large, complex datasets. Despite this trend, AI publications often suffer from lack of reproducibility and poor generalisation of findings, undermining scientific value and contributing to global research waste. To address these issues and focusing on the learning aspect of the AI field, we present RENOIR (REpeated random sampliNg fOr machIne leaRning), a modular open-source platform for robust and reproducible machine learning (ML) analysis. RENOIR adopts standardised pipelines for model training and testing, introducing elements of novelty, such as the dependence of the performance of the algorithm on the sample size. Additionally, RENOIR offers automated generation of transparent and usable reports, aiming to enhance the quality and reproducibility of AI studies. To demonstrate the versatility of our tool, we applied it to benchmark datasets from health, computer science, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) domains. Furthermore, we showcase RENOIR's successful application in recently published studies, where it identified classifiers for SET2D and TP53 mutation status in cancer. Finally, we present a use case where RENOIR was employed to address a significant pharmacological challenge—predicting drug efficacy. RENOIR is freely available at https://github.com/alebarberis/renoir .},

@article{Rodriguez-Berriguete2024,
abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) provides effective and durable responses for several tumour types by unleashing an immune response directed against cancer cells. However, a substantial number of patients treated with ICB develop relapse or do not respond, which has been partly attributed to the immune-suppressive effect of tumour hypoxia. We have previously demonstrated that the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor atovaquone alleviates tumour hypoxia both in human xenografts and in cancer patients by decreasing oxygen consumption and consequently increasing oxygen availability in the tumour. Here, we show that atovaquone alleviates hypoxia and synergises with the ICB antibody anti-PD-L1, significantly improving the rates of tumour eradication in the syngeneic CT26 model of colorectal cancer. The synergistic effect between atovaquone and anti-PD-L1 relied on CD8+ T cells, resulted in the establishment of a tumour-specific memory immune response, and was not associated with any toxicity. We also tested atovaquone in combination with anti-PD-L1 in the LLC (lung) and MC38 (colorectal) cancer syngeneic models but, despite causing a considerable reduction in tumour hypoxia, atovaquone did not add any therapeutic benefit to ICB in these models. These results suggest that atovaquone has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients treated with ICB, but predictive biomarkers are required to identify individuals likely to benefit from this intervention.},

@article{Triantafyllidis2023,
abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><p>TP53, the <i>Guardian of the Genome</i>, is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and the functional characterization of its regulation is fundamental. To address this we employ two strategies: machine learning to predict the mutation status of <i>TP53</i> <i>from transcriptomic data</i>, and directed regulatory networks to reconstruct the effect of mutations on the transcipt levels of <i>TP53</i> targets. Using data from established databases (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, The Cancer Genome Atlas), machine learning could predict the mutation status, but not resolve different mutations. On the contrary, directed network optimization allowed to infer the <i>TP53</i> regulatory profile across: (1) mutations, (2) irradiation in lung cancer, and (3) hypoxia in breast cancer, and we could observe differential regulatory profiles dictated by (1) mutation type, (2) deleterious consequences of the mutation, (3) known hotspots, (4) protein changes, (5) stress condition (irradiation/hypoxia). This is an important first step toward using regulatory networks for the characterization of the functional consequences of mutations, and could be extended to other perturbations, with implications for drug design and precision medicine.</p>},

@article{Javaid2023,
abstract = {SETD2-dependent H3 Lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) has been recently linked to the deposition of de-novo DNA methylation. SETD2 is frequently mutated in cancer, however, the functional impact of SETD2 loss and depletion on DNA methylation across cancer types and tumorigenesis is currently unknown. Here, we perform a pan-cancer analysis and show that both SETD2 mutation and reduced expression are associated with DNA methylation dysregulation across 21 out of the 24 cancer types tested. In renal cancer, these DNA methylation changes are associated with altered gene expression of oncogenes, tumour suppressors, and genes involved in neoplasm invasiveness, including TP53, FOXO1, and CDK4. This suggests a new role for SETD2 loss in tumorigenesis and cancer aggressiveness through DNA methylation dysregulation. Moreover, using a robust machine learning methodology, we develop and validate a 3-CpG methylation signature which is sufficient to predict SETD2 mutation status with high accuracy and correlates with patient prognosis.},

@article{Pasqualetti2023,
abstract = {Despite advances in the therapy of Central Nervous System (CNS) malignancies, treatment of glioblastoma (GB) poses significant challenges due to GB resistance and high recurrence rates following post-operative radio-chemotherapy. The majority of prognostic and predictive GB biomarkers are currently developed using tumour samples obtained through surgical interventions. However, the selection criteria adopted by different neurosurgeons to determine which cases are suitable for surgery make operated patients not representative of all GB cases. Particularly, geriatric and frail individuals are excluded from surgical consideration in some cancer centers. Such selection generates a survival (or selection) bias that introduces limitations, rendering the patients or data chosen for downstream analyses not representative of the entire community. In this review, we discuss the implication of survivorship bias on current and novel biomarkers for patient selection, stratification, therapy, and outcome analyses.},

  abstract = {With the increased use of next-generation sequencing generating large amounts of genomic data, gene expression signatures are becoming critically important tools for the interpretation of these data, and are poised to have a substantial effect on diagnosis, management, and prognosis for a number of diseases. It is becoming crucial to establish whether the expression patterns and statistical properties of sets of genes, or gene signatures, are conserved across independent datasets. Conversely, it is necessary to compare established signatures on the same dataset to better understand how they capture different clinical or biological characteristics. Here we describe how to use sigQC, a tool that enables a streamlined, systematic approach for the evaluation of previously obtained gene signatures across multiple gene expression datasets. We implemented sigQC in an R package, making it accessible to users who have knowledge of file input/output and matrix manipulation in R and a moderate grasp of core statistical principles. SigQC has been adopted in basic biology and translational studies, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of multiple gene signatures for potential clinical use as cancer biomarkers. This protocol uses a previously obtained signature for breast cancer metastasis as an example to illustrate the critical quality control steps involved in evaluating its expression, variability, and structure in breast tumor RNA-sequencing data, a different dataset from that in which the signature was originally derived. We demonstrate how the outputs created from sigQC can be used for the evaluation of gene signatures on large-scale gene expression datasets.},

Hi everyone, my name is Alessandro and I am a senior bioinformatician working in the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences.

## biography

I graduated from the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) (Italy) in Computer Science Engineering with a Thesis focusing on the identification of an order parameter in Monte Carlo simulations of dipolar systems on hexagonal lattices.

After completing my Master’s Degree, I started a PhD in Electronics, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering within the Custom Computing and Programmable Systems group at the same University. During my doctoral years, I specialised in High Performance Computing and Data Processing, focusing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technologies to develop real time solutions for image analysis. 

I joined the [Department of Oncology](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/) in 2014, working as a postdoc in the [Computational Biology and Integrative Genomics](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/research/research-group/computational-biology-and-integrative-genomics) group.

## research summary

My main research activity is related to the development and application of machine learning (ML) techniques to clinical cohorts. At the NDS, I study the contribution of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) to prostate cancer biology.

My current projects include:

* To study the contribution of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) to prostate cancer biology
* The derivation of multi-omic classifiers in different cancer types
* The identification of circulating biomarkers to improve radiotherapy effectiveness in glioblastoma
* The development of novel robust and reproducible computational methodologies

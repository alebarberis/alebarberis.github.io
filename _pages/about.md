Hi everyone, my name is Alessandro and I am a senior bioinformatician working in the [Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/).

My main research activity is related to the development and application of machine learning (ML) techniques to clinical cohorts.

<br>

## biography

I graduated from the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) (Italy) in Computer Science Engineering with a Thesis focusing on the identification of an order parameter in Monte Carlo simulations of dipolar systems on hexagonal lattices.

After completing my Master‚Äôs Degree, I started a PhD in Electronics, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering within the Custom Computing and Programmable Systems group at the same University. During my doctoral years, I specialised in High Performance Computing and Data Processing, focusing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technologies to develop real time solutions for image analysis. 

I joined the [Department of Oncology](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/) in 2014, working as a postdoc in the [Computational Biology and Integrative Genomics](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/research/research-group/computational-biology-and-integrative-genomics) group. Under the guidance of Professor Francesca Buffa, I have been able to expand my computational expertise, while building my knowledge of cancer genomics.

In 2022 I accepted a senior position in Professor Valentine Macaulay‚Äôs [IGF laboratory](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/research/igf-group) within the [Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/). In Professor Macaulay‚Äôs group, I keep working on cancer genomics, focusing on the contribution of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) to prostate cancer biology.

## research summary

During my postdoctoral years I specialised in the development and application of advanced statistical methods to cancer cohorts. My current focus is related to the contribution of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) to prostate cancer biology.

At the NDS, I am leading several research projects, including:

* The derivation of multi-omics classifiers in different cancer types
* The identification of circulating biomarkers to improve radiotherapy effectiveness in glioblastoma
* The development of novel robust and reproducible computational methodologies
